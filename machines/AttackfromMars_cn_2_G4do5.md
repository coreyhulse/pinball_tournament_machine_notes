#### Tech notes

Rom revision 1.13b offers a variety of awards for competitive play at the scoop as opposed to only 50m points.
Remake does not have rom 1.13b

#### Concerns

Be certain the left flipper can successfully complete the right ramp from a cradle and the right flipper can successfully complete the lock ramp from a cradle. If the flippers are not strong enough, they will need to be rebuilt. Also be sure players are capable of loop-passing when shooting the orbits. If the flipper rubbers have become worn, or deadened, to the point this technique isn't possible, they will need to be replaced prior to competition.
