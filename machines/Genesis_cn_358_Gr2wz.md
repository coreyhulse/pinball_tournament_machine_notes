#### Concerns

Be sure the vari-target is functioning properly. A clean shot from a cradled right flipper should be able to register the target at its maximum.

#### Physical Setup

- Level Machine
- Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
- Ear Plug Tilt Hack
- Verify Tilt Sensitivity - should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
- Verify no flipper disable when coin door opened. Fix if needed.
- Check Flipper Strength. If ramps are difficult, Substitute Glo Balls and see if it plays better. Alternate fix to hit ramps is to intentionally align flippers lower than normal
- Clean Playfield if necessary
- Clean Glass
- Verify Volume
