#### Tech Notes

Changing specials to award extra balls is an option. If you do this, though, replays will also award extra balls, extending play at specific scores. Therefore, you may not want to set specials to award extra balls.

#### Concerns

The extra ball target must be physically disabled to remove this feature. Based on Joker Poker's difficulty and its skill-based extra ball, consider leaving extra balls on for competition play.

#### Machine setup

- Level Machine
- Verify Tilt Sensitivity
- Check Flipper Strength. Consider Glo-ball if flippers weak or play is too slow.
- Clean Playfield if necessary
- Clean Glass
