#### Feature Adjustments


- 4 - Disable Left Ramp Diverter (Premium) - No (factory default)
  - A shot to the left ramp with lock lit goes up the diverter to the magnet. If the magnet is too unreliable then disable this diverter. Disabling the diverter will make it more possible to backhand the left ramp for a lock.

- 5 - Disable Left Ramp Up-Post - No (factory default)
  - After the magnet drops the ball (Premium) the up post holds it for video displays.

- 26 - 1st Burn it Back EB - 5
  - Factory default is Auto; for tournament play it's better to have this be a fixed number anywhere from 1 to the max value depending on how big of a factor you want early extra ball points to play.

- 30 - Bottom Lanes Difficulty - Easy (factory default)
  - Changing this to Hard may help shorten game times by encouraging players to shoot a wider variety of shots to build up bonus X and qualify mystery awards; Hard limits the lane change to just same-side changes.

- 32 - Telekinesis Lock Difficulty - Easy (factory default)
  - Changing to a harder setting makes it more difficult to start the main multiball, which can help shorten game times. Easy lights all 3 locks after one set of standups; the next level up requires a set of standups to qualify each lock.

- 34 - Telekinesis Swipe-A-Ball (Premium) - Any Locked Ball (factory default)
  - Allows the player to use one of their own locked balls as an add-a-ball in other multiball modes. Recommend against using any of the options that include Stealing locked balls from other players. May choose to change this to Off to prevent swipe-a-ball as it can lengthen game times.

- 35 - Telekinesis MB Virtual Lock (Premium) - Yes
  - Changing this to Yes means that a shot to the left ramp that locks a ball will hold it for a moment while the locked ball video displays and then return that ball to play. Use this option if locking multiple balls on the telekinesis magnet is not reliable. Use it during tournaments to make play more fair across players and to reduce the possibility of locked balls becoming dislodged when they should not.
