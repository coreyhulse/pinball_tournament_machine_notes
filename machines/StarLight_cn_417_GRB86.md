#### Concerns

Star Light is an abnormally long playing game in a competitive environment. If Star Light must be used, directors are encouraged to remove the rubbers on the outlane posts, and at events with high caliber players, consider removing the outlane posts entirely. The sensitivity of the slingshots should also be increased.
