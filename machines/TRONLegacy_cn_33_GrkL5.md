#### Tech notes

No unusual adjustments are necessary
Manage difficulty through outlanes and slingshot sensitivity

#### Concerns

If the game leans to the right and is set with no ball saver, players may complain when balls that are short-plunged drain down the right outlane. This is a very minor concern, however, since players retain multiple options off of the plunge and are in full control of how their ball begins. A very short ball saver can be added at the Director's discretion.

#### Physical setup

- Level machine
- Outlane posts as open as possible
- Verify tilt sensitivity
- Check coin door ball save
- Check flipper strength
