## Virtual lock (toybox) is needed to stop issues like

a missed lock ball not making it in may not count as an lock
ball searching dumping all locked balls into play that the game may or may not mark as in play.
uneven play some players get a safe action while others can get a hard fire into the closed box that can go slamming down SDTM
Players can do Very Soft Lock Stealing and play MB with more balls than they locked (do not get the added scoring from locking more balls)
Missed balls can also end getting stuck into the ramp.

## Optional

lower right eject power
when in virtual lock it the toy box will not open and at full power the can slam into give a little to much danger or getting stuck into the ramp.

a power setting of 135 may work good on your setup without making it to easy.

Feature setting 10 is the right eject power
