This is the Data East Game

The ball will occasionally be hang on the habitrail above the vertical upkicker if the gameï¿½s pitch is too steep. Difficulty can be adjusted by using yellow posts to guard the Add Band Member saucer on the right and by making other standard adjustments.

#### Physical Setup

- Level Machine, slightly steeper than factory recommendation
- Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
- Ear Plug Tilt Hack
- Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
- Verify no flipper disable when coin door opened. Fix if needed.
- After #34 adjustment, Check Flipper Strength, verify ramps are hittable with ease from stopped ball
- Clean Playfield if necessary
- Clean Glass
- Verify Volume
