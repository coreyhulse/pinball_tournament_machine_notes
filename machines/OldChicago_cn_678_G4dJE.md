#### Physical Setup

- Level Machine -- about 1% steeper than factory recommendation
- Playfield Panel Post Adjustment: HARD
- Ear Plug Tilt Hack
- Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
- Check Flipper Strength, Consider Glo Balls if playing too slow or can't hit upper playfield
- Ensure center eject is not easily exploitable; needs to be hard kickout. Use glo ball if needed.
- Clean/wax playfield
- Clean glass
