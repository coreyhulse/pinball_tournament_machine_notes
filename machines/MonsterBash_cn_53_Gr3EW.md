#### Tech Notes

Be sure the scoop kickout is aligned properly.

#### Concerns

Flipper codes can potentially break Lyman's Lament in a multiplayer game, but flipper codes should be against the rules in all competition anyway

#### Physical Setup

- Level Machine
- Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
- Verify Tilt Sensitivity
- Verify coin door ball save or no flipper disable when coin door opened.
- Check Flipper Strength
