#### Tech Notes

To make SnS suitable for any competition, the following changes are recommended:

- Tournament mode on (does not balance the plunge)
- Catch Up off
- Turn on Novelty mode so normal extra balls and specials are worth points.
- Remove the outlane switches. The Exit award is another source of widely unbalanced awards. Note that the outlane ball save will also be disabled when the outlane switches are removed.
- If you can Plug the Plunge hole (The Plunge awards are unbalanced and can give one player "absolutely nothing" and another player instant multiball, a completed column, or millions of points.)
- IF you Remove the outlane switches. The Exit award is another source of widely unbalanced awards. Note that the outlane ball save will also be disabled when the outlane switches are removed.
- IF Do Remove the outlane swtiches. Remove the Exit Award bulbs to make it more clear to players that no ball save or Exit Award.

#### Notes about DOUBLE

Set DOUBLE to start at DO on each ball. (Tournament mode setting) DOUBLE works like MUSTANG letters in Mustang and RANSOM letters in Black Knight 2000, but note that there's no option for it to start at the same place per player per game -- just per ball.
