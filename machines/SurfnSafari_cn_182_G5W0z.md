#### Tech Notes

There is a tournament ROM that makes Surf 'n Safari more suitable for tournament play. If you are using the stock ROM, make these physical changes along with some settings changes.

- Plug the Plunge hole
  - The Plunge awards are unbalanced and can give one player "absolutely nothing" and another player instant multiball, a completed column, or millions of points.)
- Remove the outlane switches.
  - The Exit award is another source of widely unbalanced awards.
  - Note that the outlane ball save will also be disabled when the outlane switches are removed.
  - If you do remove the outlane switches then also remove the Exit Award bulbs to make it more clear to players that there is no ball save or Exit Award.

#### Notes about DOUBLE

Set DOUBLE to start at DO on each ball. (Tournament mode setting) DOUBLE works like MUSTANG letters in Mustang and RANSOM letters in Black Knight 2000, but note that there's no option for it to start at the same place per player per game -- just per ball.
