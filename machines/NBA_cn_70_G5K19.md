#### Tech Notes
            
The magnet on the backboard can be adjusted forward or back to make shots more likely to stick. Each game is different and needs to be adjusted appropriately so players receive as high a percentage of shots as possible.

#### Concerns
Aside from frequent stuck balls, there is no major reason why NBA shouldn't be used in a tournament.

#### Physical Setup
-   Level Machine
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.
-   Verify Tilt Sensitivity
-   Verify coin door ball save or no flipper disable when coin door opened.
-   Check Flipper Strength
