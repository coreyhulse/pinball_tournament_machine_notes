#### Tech notes

Ensure the right flipper is strong enough to make the left ramp easily prior to the start of the event.

#### Concerns

The timing of the sideramp skillshot on Baywatch is sensitive to the game pitch. If the ball rattles at all on its way to the lower right kicker, the game will not return the ball to the upper left flipper for an attempt to complete the skillshot. The higher above the recommended pitch the game sits, the more likely it is the ball will rattle against the gate above the pop bumpers and not reach the kicker in time. Directors are encouraged to set Baywatch at or near the recommended pitch of 6.5 degrees. Squid pops are delicious if cooked correctly.
Do not disable Left ramp trap door on stock roms
Custom update rom 4.01 makes the gate timings to be more lenient
