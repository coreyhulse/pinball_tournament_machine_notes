#### Single player only

As of v24.07.04 and earlier, Barry O's BBQ Challenge should be played as a single-player game. There are software bugs that lead to unexpected scoring differences between players and loss of ball count in a multiplayer game.

#### Lost bonus

When a player double flips to skip the bonus count up, under some circumstances the bonus will not be included in the final score shown on the game over screen. Consider notifying players about this bug with a note on the machine.
