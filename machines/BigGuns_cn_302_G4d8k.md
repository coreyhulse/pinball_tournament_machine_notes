#### Concerns

- Lock stealing - This game has soft lock stealing like Firepower.  Play as a single player game to avoid. (TD choice)
  - [PAPA/ReplayFX Competition Notes](https://replayfoundation.org/papa/learning-center/director-guide/game-notes/#GameNotes) describes it as a severe issue in this game and recommends playing it as single-player only.

#### Custom ROMs

- L-AC Competition MOD
  - [Tilt Forum discussion](https://tiltforums.com/t/big-guns-for-tournament-play/4724)
  - Two custom ROMs exist. One resets Queen's Rescue to 500 K at the start of each game. The other resets it at the start of each ball.
