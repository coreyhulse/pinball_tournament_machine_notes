#### Tech Notes

There is little room for a director to adjust the difficulty of the ramp shots. Difficulty is determined by sling sensitivity and outlane posts.

#### Concerns

Terminator 3 tends to play too long if left at factory difficulty

#### Physical Setup

- Level Machine: 1% steeper than factory recommended
- Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. fully open position
- Remove rubber from movable outlane post, keep it on post between inlane/outlane
- Ear Plug Tilt Hack
- Verify Tilt Sensitivity -- should be sensitive, but only one danger with each hard bump
- Verify no flipper disable when coin door opened. Fix if needed.
- Check Flipper Strength, especially for hitting ramps
- Clean Playfield if necessary
- Clean Glass
- Verify Volume
