#### Tournament Mode

- Expo or PAPA (sets free play, match off, replay off, high score off)
- IFPA (sets coin play default pricing, match off, replay off, high score off)
- Do Tournament mode 1st as this resets many settings

#### Custom ROM

- A v3.01 ROM is available that changes ball save / playfield validation and kickback logic, balances scoring, fixes bugs, and introduces new settings, and generally makes the game better for tournaments.
