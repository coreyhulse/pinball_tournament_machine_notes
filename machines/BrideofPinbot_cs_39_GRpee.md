The general idea is to set up the wheel to your specifications and (hopefully) avoid bad things

| Menu | Adj. | Name | Value |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| A.2 | 01 | Extra Ball Percentage | as low as possible |
| A.2 | 02 | Extra Ball Lit Off Wheel Percentage | as low as possible |
| A.2 | 03 | Jackpot Lit Off Wheel Percentage | at your discretion |
| A.2 | 04 | Big Wheel 1 Million | at your discretion |
| A.2 | 05 | Big Wheel 10 Million | at your discretion |
| A.2 | 06 | Big Wheel 50 Million | at your discretion |
| A.2 | 07 | Big Wheel Lit Billion | **as low as possible** |
| A.2 | 08 | Special Percentage | as low as possible |
| ... | ... | | |
| A.2 | 12 | Jackpot Time Out Rate | if you want Jackpots or not |
| A.2 | 13 | Billion Lit Time Down | **as low as possible** |
| A.2 | 14 | Consolation Extra Ball Time | Set to 0 to disable |
| ... | ... | | |
| A.2 | 20 | Enter Mini Playfield (Pinbot) | can be set to HARD to make multiball harder to get to |

Billion Lit Time Down on its lowest setting generally makes it physically impossible to collect the billion point shot.
