#### Tech Notes

If the tilt and boxer mechanism are both too loose, players can shake the machine to score hits on the boxer and win bouts. If the flippers are aligned correctly, the jab ramps should both be makeable depending upon which side of the up-post the ball is resting.

#### Concerns

Early in the game, the video mode is worth an exorbitant amount of points compared to the boxing rounds, causing the winners of quick games to be determined not by who is a better pinball player but by who catches the most spit in their buckets during this mode. Later in the game after becoming Pub Champion<, players are permitted to wager significant amounts of points in cash fights, leading to highly unusual and imbalanced situations in a competitive environment. Both of these issues means Champion Pub is a poor choice for competition. The locking mechanism can prevent players from earning skillshots in multiplayer games, which can create a critical competitive imbalance between the players involved.
