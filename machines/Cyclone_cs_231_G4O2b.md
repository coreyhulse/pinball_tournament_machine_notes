### Jackpot Value
Do not use free play.

Do not let the credits reach 0.

The jackpot value increases if the game ends with zero credits and the game that was just played did not have a jackpot earned. For competition setup, take all steps necessary to ensure the game never ends with zero credits to ensure a consistent jackpot value. You cannot accomplish this by using the free play setting since that leaves the game with 0 "credits" as far as the jackpot value code is concerned. Replay level and maximum credit adjustments help to ensure the game always has credits. After configuring these settings, add credits and collect one jackpot so that the first competition game starts at the minimum jackpot value.
