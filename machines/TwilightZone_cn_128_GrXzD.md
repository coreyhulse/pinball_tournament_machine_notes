#### Tech notes

To reduce the randomness of the powerball, one normal pinball should be removed from the game, and the number of balls in the gumball should be reduced from 3 to 2. A second option is to remove the powerball entirely and set Adjustment #26 (No Powerball) to YES. The argument for removing the powerball entirely is that it eliminates randomness, the argument against removing it is that it changes a major feature of the game too drastically and that leaving it but lowering the number of balls in the gumball machine is fair enough. The difficulty of Twilight Zone is determined primarily by the consistency of the slot machine kickout and the left outlane. Consistent kickouts are preferred in all instances. Directors are encouraged to leave the outlane post on the left in the game unless removing it is absolutely necessary.

#### Concerns

The game allocation of the powerball is somewhat random

#### Physical setup

- Verify machine Level
- Known power issues for flippers and kickouts: troubleshoot and fix
- Outlane posts as open as possible
- Make slingshots sensitive
- Install ear plug tilt hack
- Verify tilt sensitivity
- Verify no flipper disable when coin door opened. Fix if needed.
- Check flipper strength
- Clean playfield if necessary
- Clean glass
- Verify volume
- Remove one ball so only two are left in the gumball machine
