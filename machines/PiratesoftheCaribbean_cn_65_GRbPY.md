#### Game Version

- This is the version by Jersey Jack Pinball, 2018

#### Concerns

- There are a variety of characters available for selection by the players.  Each character is only selectable by a single player.  Options to address include allowing for order choice on the machine, or you could play as single player game to allow character parity.
- Plunder can have a sigificantly unbalanced effect on game play and should be disabled in settings for tournament play (or play single player games).
