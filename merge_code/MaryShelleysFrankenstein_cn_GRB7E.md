## Tech Notes
            
In formats where competitors will be allowed to play the game repeatedly, such as the Best-Game or PAPA Qualifying format, Adjustment 53, Ramp Memory, Should be set to HARD. In formats where competitors will only be allowed to play the game once (or a limited, low number of times), this Adjustment should be set to MODERATE. Finally, directors should put a sign on the backglass reminding players they have a choice of music, and while Edgar Winter is certainly awesome in many ways -most especially his flowing white mullet- choosing the orchestral movie music option at the beginning of the game every once in a while will keep scorekeepers from going batshit crazy after listening to Winter�s supersweet guitar riff for 10 straight hours.## Concerns
Frankenstein is a bit of a one-shot wonder provided the left flipper is strong enough to reach the ramp, though the game is serviceable for competition overall.

-   Level Machine, slightly steeper than factory recommendation
-   Outlane Posts on "Hard Settings". I.e. most open.

-   Verify coin door ball save or no flipper disable when coin door opened.
-   After #34 adjustment, Check Flipper Strength, ensure right ramp is easily hittable from stopped ball.
-   Clean Playfield if necessary
